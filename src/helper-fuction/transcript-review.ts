Categories:

Interested: The lead clearly expresses interest, agrees to book an appointment, or continues discussing next steps.

Not-Interested: The lead explicitly says they are no longer interested, have found a solution, or expresses disinterest.

Scheduled: The lead confirms a specific time for an appointment or meeting.

Call-Back: The lead requests the agent to call back later or suggests following up in the future.

Incomplete: The call ends abruptly, or the lead cannot be reached before answering any key questions.

Voicemail: The call results in leaving a voicemail or the agent reaches the lead's voicemail system.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the transcript below and assign it the most fitting category based on the lead's responses.
2. If the transcript is empty or missing, respond with N/A.
